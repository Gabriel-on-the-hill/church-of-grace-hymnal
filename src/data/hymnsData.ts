      id: 17, title: "Once in Royal David's City", author: "Cecil Frances Alexander", year: "1848", category: "Jesus Christ", categoryId: 2, lyrics: `1. Once in royal David's city
   Stood a lowly cattle shed,
   Where a mother laid her baby
   In a manger for His bed:
   Mary was that mother mild,
   Jesus Christ her little child.

2. He came down to earth from heaven,
   Who is God and Lord of all,
   And His shelter was a stable,
   And His cradle was a stall;
   With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
   Lived on earth our Savior holy.

3. And through all His wondrous childhood
   He would honor and obey,
   Love and watch the lowly Maiden
   In whose gentle arms He lay;
   Christian children all must be
   Mild, obedient, good as He.

4. For He is our childhood's pattern;
   Day by day, like us, He grew;
   He was little, weak, and helpless,
   Tears and smiles, like us He knew;
   And He feeleth for our sadness
   And He shareth in our gladness.

5. And our eyes at last shall see Him,
   Through His own redeeming love;
   For that Child so dear and gentle,
   Is our Lord in heaven above:
   And He leads His children on,
   To the place where He is gone.

6. Not in that poor lowly stable,
   With the oxen standing by,
   We shall see Him; but in heaven,
   Set at God's right hand on high;
   Where like stars His children crowned
   All in white shall wait around.` },

   All seated on the ground,
   The angel of the Lord came down,
   And glory shone around.

2. "Fear not!" said He, for mighty dread
   Had seized their troubled mind;
   "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
   To you and all mankind."

3. "To you, in David's town, this day,
   Is born of David's line
   A Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
   And this shall be the sign:

4. "The heavenly Babe you there shall find
   To human view displayed,
   All meanly wrapped in swaddling-clothes
   And in a manger laid."

5. Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
   Appeared a shining throng
   Of angels, praising God, and thus
   Addressed their joyful song:

6. "All glory be to God on high,
   And to the earth be peace;
   Good will henceforth from Heaven to men
   Begin and never cease."` },

   He lived and died, to buy my pardon,
   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

Chorus:
   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
   Because He lives, all fear is gone;
   Because I know He holds the future,
   And life is worth the living, Just because He lives!

2. How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
   And feel the pride and joy he gives;
   But sweeter still the calm assurance,
   This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

3. And then one day I'll cross the river,
   I'll fight life's final war with pain;
   And then, as death gives way to victory,
   I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!` },

   The emblem of suff'ring and shame,
   And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best
   For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus:
   So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
   Till my trophies at last I lay down;
   I will cling to the old rugged cross,
   And exchange it some day for a crown.

2. O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
   Has a wondrous attraction for me;
   For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
   To bear it to dark Calvary.

3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
   A wondrous beauty I see,
   For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
   To pardon and sanctify me.

4. To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
   Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
   Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
   Where His glory forever I'll share.` },

   Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide,
   The promise assures us, "The Lord will provide."

2. The birds, without garner or storehouse, are fed;

   And courage all fails us, we triumph by faith.
   He cannot take from us, though oft he has tried,
   This heart-cheering promise, "The Lord will provide."

4. No strength of our own, and no goodness we claim;
   Yet, since we have known of the Savior's great name,
   In this our strong tower for safety we hide:
   The Lord is our power, "The Lord will provide."

5. When life sinks apace, and death is in view,
   The word of His grace shall comfort us through;
   Not fearing nor doubting, with Christ on our side,

   'Tis mine to obey, 'tis His to provide;
   Though cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail,
   The word He has spoken shall surely prevail.

3. His love in time past forbids me to think
   He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink;
   Each time He has helped me lies clearly in view,
   Designed to assure me He'll pilot me through.

4. Since all that I meet shall work for my good,
   The bitter is sweet, the medicine food;

   Not a grief or a loss,
   Not a frown or a cross,
   But is blest if we trust and obey.

4. But we never can prove
   The delights of His love
   Until all on the altar we lay;
   For the favor He shows,
   For the joy He bestows,

5. Then in fellowship sweet
   We will sit at His feet,
   Or we'll walk by His side in the way;

   When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God
   I commune as friend with friend!

4. There are depths of love that I cannot know
   Till I cross the narrow sea;
   There are heights of joy that I may not reach
   Till I rest in peace with Thee.` },

   Take my lips and let them be
   Filled with messages from Thee.

4. Take my silver and my gold,
   Not a mite would I withhold;
   Take my intellect and use
   Every power as Thou shalt choose.

5. Take my will and make it Thine,
   It shall be no longer mine;
   Take my heart, it is Thine own,

   All to leave and follow Thee;
   Destitute, despised, forsaken,
   Thou from hence my all shalt be.
   Perish every fond ambition,
   All I've sought or hoped or known;
   Yet how rich is my condition!
   God and heav'n are still my own.

2. Let the world despise and leave me,
   They have left my Savior too;
   Human hearts and looks deceive me;
   Thou art not, like them, untrue;
   And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
   God of wisdom, love, and might,
   Foes may hate and friends may shun me;
   Show Thy face, and all is bright.

3. Go then, earthly fame and treasure!
   Come disaster, scorn and pain!
   In Thy service, pain is pleasure;
   With Thy favor, loss is gain.
   I have called Thee, "Abba, Father";
   I have stayed my heart on Thee;
   Storms may howl, and clouds may gather,
   All must work for good to me.

4. Man may trouble and distress me,
   'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
   Life with trials hard may press me,
   Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest.
   Oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
   While Thy love is left to me;
   Oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me,
   Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

5. Take, my soul, thy full salvation;
   Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care;
   Joy to find in every station
   Something still to do or bear.
   Think what Spirit dwells within thee;
   What a Father's smile is thine;
   What a Savior died to win thee;
   Child of heav'n, shouldst thou repine?

6. Haste then on from grace to glory,
   Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
   Heav'n's eternal day's before thee,
   God's own hand shall guide thee there.
   Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
   Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days;
   Hope shall change to glad fruition,
   Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.` },

   By faith, on heaven's tableland,
   A higher plane than I have found;

2. My heart has no desire to stay
   Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
   Though some may dwell where those abound,
   My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

3. I want to live above the world,
   Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
   For faith has caught the joyful sound,
   The song of saints on higher ground.

4. I want to scale the utmost height
   And catch a gleam of glory bright;
   But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,
   "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."` }

   Lift high His royal banner, It must not suffer loss:
   From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead,
   Till ev'ry foe is vanquished, And Christ is Lord indeed.

2. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, The trumpet call obey;
   Forth to the mighty conflict, In this His glorious day:
   Ye that are men now serve Him Against unnumbered foes;
   Let courage rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose.

3. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, Stand in His strength alone;
   The arm of flesh will fail you, Ye dare not trust your own:
   Put on the gospel armor, Each piece put on with prayer;
   Where duty calls, or danger, Be never wanting there.

4. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, The strife will not be long;
   This day the noise of battle, The next the victor's song:
   To him that overcometh, A crown of life shall be;
   He with the King of glory Shall reign eternally.

5. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, Each soldier keep his place;
   Unfurl the Christian banner In this the day of grace.
   In love and truth and mercy Exalt the Savior's name,
   And by a life of service His wondrous love proclaim.

6. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, The Lord your strength shall be;
   No foe shall ever harm you, While on His side are ye.
   The battle is the Lord's own, The victory is sure;
   His name shall be exalted, Both now and evermore.` },

   Hung the issue of the day;

   Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod;
   We are not divided, all one body we,
   One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

4. Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,
   But the church of Jesus constant will remain;
   Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
   We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.

5. Onward, then, ye people, join our happy throng,
   Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song;

   Our hope for years to come,
   Our shelter from the stormy blast,

   Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
   And our eternal home.

   The promise of that faithful word
   Even here to me fulfill.` }
